Ideas:
- I should probably add some tests :this-is-fine:
- Should it be possible to add slash commands from _within_ obsidian somehow?
- It would be cool to have a command pallete command that lets you start a new session for the current note (maybe by running a slash command and @-ing the file, or maybe by running a user configured saved prompt)
- Move Mode to the chat box, add a hotkey for it
