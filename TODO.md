Ideas:
- [x] I should probably add some tests :this-is-fine:
- [ ] Should it be possible to add slash commands from _within_ obsidian somehow?
- [x] It would be cool to have a command pallete command that lets you start a new session for the current note (maybe by running a slash command, or maybe by running a user configured saved prompt)
- [ ] (blocked until ACP supports model listing) allow model picking, again as a dropdown on/near the chat box
- [x] Auth MCP somehow (or switch to socket based)
- [ ] Allow User specified MCP
- [ ] Granular permission
    - [ ] Support file + folder based white/blacklist
- [x] Allow User to specify the default view (left/right leaf, editor, split)
- [x] Document that mobile support is OOS
- [x] Add hotkey support for:
    - [x] New conversation
    - [x] Focus input
    - [x] Approve/Reject tool
    - [x] Cancel current operation
- [x] Investigate showing folders starting with . as a plugin feature
    - *Result*: Implementation requires extensive monkey-patching of private APIs (as seen in `obsidian-show-hidden-files`).
    - *Decision*: Agent access is solved via adapter fallback. UI visibility should be handled by the dedicated `obsidian-show-hidden-files` plugin to avoid code duplication and fragility. Added recommendation to README.
- [x] Remove git integration
- [x] Improve graph knowledge
    - [x] Add backlinks to context when adding note
    - [ ] Enable graph queries, add that to system prompt
- [ ] Triggers from canvas? Maybe let people add a canvas item and see it "get worked"

- [ ] Clippy? Is that a horrible idea?
  - [ ] Background sessions
      - [ ]  subscribe to a subset of events, attempt to detect user sentiment and start a session if the user would benefit
  - [ ] Ambient Session
      - [ ] Requires compaction/special prompting
      - [ ] subscribe to all events, attempt to detect user sentiment/goals. Suggest "new session to do X" when appropriate
