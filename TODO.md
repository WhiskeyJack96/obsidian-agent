Ideas:
- Could we add custom https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/extensibility#extension-methods to provide vault search methods?
    - This would likely be worse quality than letting an agent run bash, but it would be _MUCH_ safer
- Could we render diffs to files in a pretty way?
- I should probably add some tests :this-is-fine:
- Should it be possible to add slash commands from _within_ obsidian somehow?
- It would be cool to have a command pallete command that lets you start a new session for the current note (maybe by running a slash command and @-ing the file, or maybe by running a user configured saved prompt)
- Saving sessions (pending claude acp adaptor support)
